# Verify backend output

Prove behavior with executed requests, not code reading. A compiling server
and a green broad suite are supporting evidence; the verdict comes from
requests you sent and responses you observed.

You verify and report. Findings go back to the dispatcher — propose the
smallest fix, change nothing yourself.

## Project bindings

Resolve before scenario one, from the repo's `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` or its
`docs/agents/` notes:

- **Command boundary** — whether commands run directly or through a wrapper
  (a `devcontainer` skill, `make`, a task runner). Every command below assumes
  that prefix when one exists.
- **Backend package** — its `dev`, `test`, and `lint` commands, and the port
  and health path the server exposes.
- **Contract seam** — the contract source and its regen command, when the repo
  is contract-first.
- **Deploy target** — whether a deployed stack and credentials exist for the
  optional smoke pass.

## 1. Build the scenario list

Read the sub-issue, the parent's acceptance criteria, and the contract. Turn
each criterion into a scenario: the request(s) to send, the exact observable
outcome (status code, body shape, ordering), and any prior state it needs.
Every scenario traces to a criterion or a contract clause; every backend
criterion gets a scenario or an explicit Blocked with the reason.

## 2. Stand the system up

Bring the environment up through the command boundary, start the API in the
background, and health-check it before any scenario runs. A server that never
comes up is a Blocked verdict with the startup log as evidence, and stops the
run.

## 3. Wire requests and drive flows

Send every scenario's requests with `curl` through the command boundary,
recording the exact command and response for evidence. Single requests check
shape; **flows** check the product: seed or create the prior state through the
API, drive the multi-step path the criterion describes (create → list → mutate
→ observe), and assert what a second fetch shows — list truth, stable
ordering, state transitions reaching their terminal values, and correct
statuses on invalid input (`400`/`404`/`409`).

Statelessness is part of the contract wherever the deploy target is
horizontally scaled or serverless: a flow must not depend on hitting the same
process twice. Restart the API mid-flow when a scenario smells of in-process
state, and treat surviving state as store-backed truth, lost state as a
finding.

Drive only the flows the changed surface touches; name the ones you skipped.

## 4. Check the contract and the tests

- Regen is a no-op, when the repo is contract-first: run the generate command,
  then `git diff --exit-code` (git on the host) — drift between spec and
  generated code fails this.
- Run the package's own tests. When the sub-issue names required test
  deliverables, a missing required test is a Failed finding, not a note.
- Run the linter. Every linter the repo configures reports a defect, so a
  finding is a Failed verdict, not a note. Silence one only with a suppression
  comment carrying a reason the diff can justify.

## 5. Deployed smoke (when credentials and a stack exist)

When the environment carries real credentials and a deployed stack exists,
close with a smoke section: replay a happy-path subset of the scenarios
against the deployed URL with plain `curl`. No credentials or no stack → state
that and skip; never mark the local verdicts Blocked over it.

## 6. Report

Per scenario: **Passed**, **Failed**, or **Blocked** — never a status for an
outcome you did not observe. Each verdict carries its evidence: the command,
the response, and for failures a cause classification (product bug, contract
drift, environment, spec ambiguity) plus the smallest proposed fix. Redact
secrets and real user data; fixture data can be quoted whole. Close with the
criteria left unverified and why.

Done when every backend acceptance criterion holds a verdict backed by a
request you sent and a response you read; every Failed verdict names its cause
class and its smallest fix; every Blocked verdict names the gate that stopped
it; and the contract regen, the package's tests and its linter have each been
run and reported. A criterion with no scenario is unverified, and unverified
is reported, not omitted.
